# Prochess

Just a simple chess-like game where you can see processes playing between them.

## Disclaimer

This is a project I was asked to to by my university, I'm not a C programmer and C language is not my cup of tea. Keep this in mind when reading the code as it could not follow C's best practices and it might have been made a way better than this.

## Compiling & running

To compile the project just run `make` in the project directory, then execute the program built by typing `./prochess`.
